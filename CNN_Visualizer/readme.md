The CNN Features Maps Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to see the inner workings of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It allows users to upload their own images and observe how a pre-trained CNN processes them layer by layer, revealing the "features" that each convolutional filter learns to detect.
